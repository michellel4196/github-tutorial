# GitHub Tutorial

## Git vs. GitHub

* **Git** = version control (keeps a snapshot of your code)
  * **This does not require Github**
  * Runs in command line
  * Basic workflow:
     * You have a directory (folder) with files in them
     * When you initialize git, it's called a repository (repo)
  * 
* **Github** = stores your code in the cloud (internet)
  * **This reguires git**
  * Makes it easier to track the changes in your code
  * Easier to collaborate on files (you can help someone else with their project)
